    <h1>The Heart Behind MythicMC</h1>

    <p>
      We didn’t start MythicMC because it was easy.  
      We started it because something we loved was being destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Minecraft used to feel like home — a place to create, compete, and connect.  
      But for many of us, that home was lost to cheaters, toxic servers, and corrupted communities.  
      On <strong>zentic.cc</strong>, we watched that loss unfold firsthand.  
      It wasn’t just about hacked clients.  
      It was about feeling invisible.  
      It was about logging in with hope, and logging off with disappointment.
    </p>

    <h2>We Could Have Quit — But We Didn’t</h2>

    <p>
      We gathered in voice calls and typed in chats late into the night.  
      Angry. Frustrated. Tired. But not defeated.  
      That’s when we realized: if no one else would build the server we deserved — <em>we would.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      So, we stood up. We organized a boycott.  
      We spoke out.  
      And when enough voices said, “Enough is enough,” a new world began to form:
    </p>

    <h2>That World Is MythicMC</h2>

    <p>
      A Minecraft server born from rebellion.  
      Built by players, for players.  
      A place where fairness isn’t optional — it’s enforced.  
      Where every duel, every block, and every moment is protected from the pain we came from.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Believe In</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integrity That Doesn’t Flinch:</strong> Our anti-cheat isn’t just tech — it’s a promise we made to ourselves, and to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Players Over Profit:</strong> We’d rather grow slow and honest than fast and fake.</li>
      <li><strong>Support That Listens:</strong> When you speak, someone hears you. We moderate with compassion, not just commands.</li>
      <li><strong>Everyone Belongs:</strong> Whether you’re a PvP god or a cozy builder, you have a home here.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why MythicMC Matters</h2>

    <p>
      Because it’s not just about games.  
      It’s about standing up when it’s easier to walk away.  
      It’s about community, not control.  
      It’s about remembering that you matter — your effort, your talent, your story.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
      This is more than a server.  
      This is redemption.  
      This is your second chance to love Minecraft again.
    </p>
